# Receptionist Medical Records - Documents Upload Fix

## Issue Fixed
Documents uploaded by receptionist were not being saved. Upload showed success but documents didn't appear.

## Root Cause
**Schema Mismatch:** Backend was saving to `record.documents` but the MedicalRecord schema only had `attachments` field.

## Solution

### Updated MedicalRecord Model Schema

Added 4 new fields:

1. **`documents` array** - For receptionist-uploaded lab results
2. **`treatmentPlan` string** - Doctor's treatment plan
3. **`labTests` array** - Lab tests ordered by doctor
4. **Updated `diagnosis.severity`** - Added 'mild' and 'severe' options

### Added Debug Logging

Frontend now logs:
- Patient medical history fetch
- Document upload process
- API responses
- Errors with full details

Check browser console (F12) to see the upload flow.

## How to Test

1. Login as receptionist
2. Search and select a patient
3. Go to "Upload Lab Tests" tab
4. Select a treatment plan (should see doctor's details)
5. Click upload area and select PDF/JPG/PNG files
6. Click "Upload Documents to this Visit"
7. **Watch for:**
   - Success toast
   - Green pulsing animation (3 seconds)
   - "NEW!" bouncing badge
   - Document links appear
   - Badge changes from "No documents yet" → "✓ X document(s)"

## What's Fixed

- ✅ Documents now save to database
- ✅ Documents appear immediately after upload
- ✅ Green animation highlights newly uploaded docs
- ✅ Document count badge updates
- ✅ Download links work correctly
- ✅ Console logs help debugging

## Server Restarted

The server has been restarted with the updated model schema. The documents field is now available in the database.
