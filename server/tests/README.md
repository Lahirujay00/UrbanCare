✓ should validate appointment is in the future
✓ should validate business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
✓ should validate weekday appointments only

// Negative Cases  
✓ should handle doctor not found
✓ should handle scheduling conflicts
✓ should reject invalid patient role

// Edge Cases
✓ should enforce minimum 24-hour advance booking

- ✅ **Response Formatting**: Consistent API responses

**Key Test Cases:**
```javascript
// API Endpoints
✓ POST /api/appointments - Create appointment
✓ GET /api/appointments/patient/:id - Get patient appointments
✓ PUT /api/appointments/:id/cancel - Cancel appointment
✓ GET /api/appointments/alternatives - Get alternative doctors

// Security
✓ should require authentication for all endpoints
✓ should enforce role-based authorization
✓ should sanitize malicious input (XSS, SQL injection)
✓ should validate ObjectId formats
```

### **4. Integration Tests**

#### **AppointmentFlow.test.js** - 25+ test cases
- ✅ **Complete UC02 Flow**: End-to-end appointment booking
- ✅ **All Alternate Flows**: Doctor unavailable, payment failure
- ✅ **All Exception Flows**: Cancellations, refunds, system errors
- ✅ **Concurrent Scenarios**: Multiple users, race conditions

**Key Test Cases:**
```javascript
// Main Success Scenario (Steps 1-9)
✓ Complete appointment booking with payment
✓ Hospital verification and confirmation
✓ Patient notification delivery

// Alternate Flows
✓ 4a. Doctor fully booked - suggest alternatives
✓ 6a. Payment failure - retry mechanism
✓ 8a. Appointment rejection - refund processing

// Exception Flows
✓ Appointment cancellation with refund policy
✓ Concurrent booking attempts for same slot
✓ System downtime during payment processing
```
