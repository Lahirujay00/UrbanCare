## 🏆 **COVERAGE VERIFICATION COMMANDS**

### **Individual Use Case Testing (What Examiner Will Run):**

```bash
# Team Member 1 - Patient Account Management
npm run test:patient-mgmt

# Team Member 2 - Make an Appointment  
npm run test:appointments

# Team Member 3 - Patient ID & Record Access
npm run test:records

# Team Member 4 - Generate Reports
npm run test:reports
```

### **All Use Cases Together:**
```bash
npm run test:usecases
```

## 📊 **EXPECTED OUTPUT FORMAT**

Each test command will show:

```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests: XX passed, XX total
Snapshots: 0 total

-----------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
File                         | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines |
-----------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
ServiceName.js               |   85.23  |   82.15  |   88.46  |   86.12 |
-----------------------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|
```
