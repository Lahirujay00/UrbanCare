## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes

#### File: `client/src/pages/receptionist/ReceptionistDashboard.js`

**New State Variables:**
```javascript
const [patientMedicalHistory, setPatientMedicalHistory] = useState([]);
const [selectedFiles, setSelectedFiles] = useState([]);
```

**New Functions:**

3. `removeFile(index)` - Removes file from selection
4. `uploadDocuments(medicalRecordId)` - Uploads documents to created record

**Updated Functions:**
- `createMedicalRecord()` - Now uploads documents after creating record and refreshes history

**New useEffect Hook:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (selectedPatient && activeTab === 'records') {
    fetchPatientMedicalHistory(selectedPatient._id);
  }
}, [selectedPatient, activeTab]);
```

**UI Enhancements:**
- Added medical history display section (shows previous records)
- Added document upload section with drag-and-drop interface
- Added selected files list with remove buttons
- Color-coded severity badges (red=critical, orange=severe, yellow=moderate, green=mild)
